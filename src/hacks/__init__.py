"""Collection of hacks of varying degrees of dirtiness.

This is a subpackage containing various modules based on questionable design
choices and with possible harmful side-effects.
Despite the iffiness associated with them, these modules can be useful when
used under the right circumstances, hence they haven't been dropped from
gonium."""
